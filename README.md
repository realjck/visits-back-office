# Visits back-office

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## About

This is a personal back-office project that lists visitors in a second-life place. It uses an LSL (Linden Scripting Language) script for the Second Life part to record visits and users in a database hosted by Xano (no-code API system), it records their arrival time, their name and departure time.

The frontend part present in this repository works with React JS and allows to display and sort this data.

This project is hosted in this directory via Github Pages
